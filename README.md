# Premier-League-Match-Prediction
(NOT COMPLETED) Program utilising a deep artificial neural network to learn from and predict the outcome of Barclays Premier League matches.


UPDATE - after some research, I have concluded that dnns are not the best method for classifing this problem as they are unable to pick out the necessary features. I am currently working with random forest classifiers at the moment.
